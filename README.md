# Semantic-Image-Segmentation
It invloves fine-tuning the DenseASPP model for semantic image segmentation with three classes, roads, trees, and buildings, and creating a mini network of DenseASPP for semantic segmentation of images around the University of New Haven. 

The finetuned model is trained in notebook Finetuned_denseASPP_model.ipynb .

The mini network model is in the notebook Mini_network_DenseASPP.ipynb

## Steps to run the notebooks: 

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git clone https://github.com/bhandarijyoti12/Semantic-Image-Segmentation
``` 

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project:
```
cd your-repo-name
```

3. Run both the notebook in Google Collab as it requires GPU.
4. Read the paper Final_Project_Full_Report.pdf uploaded in this repo. This is the original research paper for this project and contains all the details about the datasets, process and explanation.
